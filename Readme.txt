Brief of our app:
-------------------------------
KiKat is an android chat application implementing p2p socketing which enables exchanging messages and text files between people connected through this app.

Base Features:
--------------
- The users must have same WiFi connection and when the system is loaded, system is assigned with a default port (8080) and the server starts automatically, and it needs the IP address of the other device to connect with. 
- A well-designed GUI which has a text-edit box to type messages and a send button to send it to the other user connected.
- An image button seems like file-icon enables exchanging text files between the devices connected when it is clicked.
- There's a option on the menubar to save exchanged messages.
- There's also a change background option on the menu item to change the background image for both connected users simultaneously.

Extra features: 
---------------
- A splash screen which appears upon loading the app.
- An App Icon is also added.
- Menubar with dot menu and connect icon is added at the top.
- Chatbox UI is made authentic with bubble wrapping and proper text padding.

User Manual:
------------
The users must be in the same WiFi network and then they need to start their app. Immediately after booting, the app starts the server on port 8080 automatically. One of the user needs to put the IP address of the other device. For this, we have a "+" symboled icon on menubar. The user needs to click on it and it will show up a pop-up window and the user must put the IP address of the other user and press "connect" button on that pop-up window. The pop-up will be gone and the devices are connected and are ready to chat.

If they want to send messages there's a edit text box to type messages and a send imagebutton to send them at the bottom. 
Again, in the bottom there's a file icon button to send text files. Clicking that takes the users to their files folder and when they select any text file, the file is sent to the other user and gets saved there.

When the dots on menubar is clicked there are two more options: "Save Chat" and "Change Background". By clicking on "Save Chat" , the chat gets saved as text files in that device. Again, clicking on "change background" changes background for both users.
